 * We have functions f,gÂ :R->R, where 
 * f(x)=a*x+b and 
 * g(x)=c*x+d
 * Find the intersection point in the graphs of thse 2 functions.
 * Since these are linear functions, their graphs are lines.
 * We consider that this point has (x, y) coordinates. So, at the point of \
 * intersection the (x, y) coordinates for function 1 equal the (x, y) \
 * coordinates for function 2.
 * Since at the point of intersection the two y-coordinates are equal, the \
 * y-coordinate from Line 1 equal to the y-coordinate from Line 2.
 * The y-coordinate for Line 1 is calculated this way:
 * y = ax + b
 * The y-coordinate for Line 2 is calculated this way:
 * y = cx + d
 * Setting the two y-coordinates equal looks like this:
 * ax + b = cx + d
 * From here we can find out the x using algebra.
 * ax - cx = d - b
 * x(a - c) = d - b
 * x = (d - b)/(a - c)
